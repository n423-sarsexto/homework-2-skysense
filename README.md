## Summer Sexton - N423

An interactive weather-telling application making use of [Weather API's](https://www.weatherapi.com/) free Weather API. Input a zipcode or city name and learn current weather information in both fahrenheit and celsius. Get a description on a six-hour upcoming forecast, as well as the next four days of weather.

This application was programmed using SASS, HTML, and Javascript. It made heavy use of the API's JSON for data.

One goal of this application was to put together a piece that could be added to my overall portfolio. While it breaks one of my personal rules of never using an image as a background, I feel that it fits the overall aesthetic and mission. Making use of a lot of the API's data in a legible format isn't easy, and I am rather proud of how it came out.
